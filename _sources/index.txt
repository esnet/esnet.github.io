ESnet Software
==============

The Energy Sciences Network (ESnet_) is a high-performance, unclassified
national network built to support scientific research. Funded by the U.S.
Department of Energyâ€™s Office of Science (SC) and managed by Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory, ESnet provides services to more than 40 DOE research
sites, including the entire National Laboratory system, its supercomputing
facilities, and its major scientific instruments. ESnet also connects to 140
research and commercial networks, permitting DOE-funded scientists to
productively collaborate with partners around the world.

As part of supporting ESnet's mission we develop quite a bit of software. This
page has links to each of ESnet's publically visible software projects.

esmond_
    esmond is a package for collecting time series data. It is primarily used
    as part of the perfSONAR toolkit.

iperf_
    iperf is a TCP, UDP, and SCTP network bandwidth measurement tool.

MaDDash_
    MaDDash is a tool for displaying perfSONAR_ point-to-point network measurements and other "two-dimensional" data as a set of grids referred to as a dashboard

sLS_ 
    sLS (Simple Lookup Service) is a key-value based distributed database with a REST/JSON API.

`Timeseries Charts`_
    A set of modular charting components used for building flexible interactive charts. It was built for React from the ground up, specifically to visualize timeseries data and network traffic data in particular.

`Network Diagrams`_
    A set of React based mapping components which are used within the ESnet Portal, but are not tied to ESnet, or even to network visualization.

Pond_
    A library build on top of immutable.js to provide basic timeseries functionality within ESnet tools.
